# Assembly Programs for Computer Architecture Course

This repository contains small assembly language programs I've created in my Computer Architecture course using MIPS in the MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) program. These programs are designed to demonstrate various concepts and techniques I've learned throughout the course.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you will need the [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm) simulator, which supports MIPS assembly language. You will also need the [Java Runtime](https://www.java.com/en/download/) on your system. Follow the instructions for setting up MARS and Java to assemble and execute the programs. 

## Programs

- `Lab1.asm`: This project demonstrates how converting number forms works in Assembly. It also gives a good idea of how bitmasks work on a system level.
- `Lab2.asm`: This project demonstrates the basics of loops, jumps and syscalls in Assembly and how they are handled.
- `Lab3.asm`: This project demonstrates input/output as well as how multiplication is handled in Assembly.
